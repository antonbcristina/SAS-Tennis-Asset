# SAS-Tennis-Asset
This repository provides source datasets and all necessary programs used to create the dataset DEMO_RANK_MATCHES used in the SAS Academic Program teaching and learning asset titled: "Exploring Tennis Players’ Earnings in SAS Visual Analytics".

The analysis begins by working with the **Forbes_Richest_Athletes_1990-2020.csv** (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/forbes-highest-paid-athletes-19902019). For each year, the top 10 highest paid athletes are included. Earnings totals include salaries, bonuses, prize money, endorsements, and appearance fees. To help our exploration, the data was cleaned by adding the Team Sport column (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport), the column names were standardized, and the observation number was removed. 

The next dataset used is **Athlete_Earnings.xlsx** (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dimitrisangelide/top-10-highestpaid-athletes-tennis-nba-soccer). This data was extracted from Forbes on the top 10 highest-paid athletes in tennis, NBA, and soccer from 2011-2021. To better display how athletes earn their money, their total earnings are broken down into prize money and endorsements. Data prep completed includes standardizing variable names and adding the Team_Sport column based on whether the Team variable was missing or not. 

In Part 2 of the activity, we introduce the **demo_rank_matches.sas7bdat** dataset. This SAS dataset was created by combining multiple data sources from the Git repositories maintained by Jeff Sackman (https://github.com/JeffSackmann). The repositories contain master files for players in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), including demographic information, historical rankings and match results for tournaments played. SAS scripts required for data manipulation, merging and links to source files are found in this repo.
