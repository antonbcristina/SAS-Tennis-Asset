# SAS-Tennis-Asset
This repository provides the necessary programs used to create the dataset DEMO_RANK_MATCHES used in the SAS Academic Program teaching and learning asset titled: "Exploring Tennis Players’ Earnings in SAS Visual Analytics".

In Part 2 of the activity, we introduce the demo_rank_matches.sas7bdat dataset. This SAS dataset was created by combining multiple data sources from the Git repositories maintained by Jeff Sackman (https://github.com/JeffSackmann). The repositories contain master files for players in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), including demographic information, historical rankings and match results for tournaments played. SAS scripts required for data manipulation, merging and links to source files are found here.
