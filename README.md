# SAS-Tennis-Asset
This repository provides the necessary programs used to create the dataset DEMO_RANK_MATCHES used in the SAS Academic Program teaching and learning asset titled: "Tennis Players’ Earnings".

In Part 2 of this activity, we introduce the DEMO_RANK_MATCHES dataset. This dataset was created by combining multiple data sources from the Git repositories maintained by Jeff Sackman (https://github.com/JeffSackmann). His repositories contain master files for players in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), including demographic information, historical rankings and match results for tournaments played. SAS scripts required for data manipulation, merging and links to source files are included here.
